The Unsplash Dataset is composed of multiple TSV files:

## 1 - photos.tsv

The `photos.tsv` dataset has one row per photo. It contains properties of the photo, the name of the contributor, the image URL, and overall stats.

## 2 - keywords.tsv

The `keywords.tsv` dataset has one row per photo-keyword pair. It contains data
about how a keyword is connected to a photo and the conversions of the photo our search engine for a particular keyword.

| Field                         | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|

| suggested_by_user             | Whether the keyword was added by a user (human) |

## 3 - collections.tsv

*Note: A collection on Unsplash is a user created grouping of photos. These are similar to boards on Pinterest and can often group photos in complex and creative ways.*

The `collections.tsv` dataset has one row per photo-collection pair. Whenever a photo
belongs to a collection created by a user, it will appear as one row. Each row describes
when the photo was added to the collection and gives the title of the collection.

| Field                         | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| photo_id                      | ID of the Unsplash photo |

| collection_title              | Title of the collection containing the photo |
| photo_collected_at            | Timestamp of when the photo was added to the collection |

## 4 - conversions.tsv

*Note: a conversion is currently defined as a user selecting an image to download it.*

The `conversions.tsv` dataset has one row per search conversion. The dataset tells you which photo has been downloaded for a search, the country of origin, and an anonymous identifier to indiciate the unique users. The data goes back up to 1 year before the release of each version of the dataset.

| Field                         | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| converted_at                  | Timestamp of the conversion event |

| keyword                       | Keyword that was searched and led to the conversion |
| photo_id                      | Photo ID of the photo that converted |
| anonymous_user_id             | Anonymous user ID |
| conversion_country            | Country code of the device geolocation |

## 5 - colors.tsv

*Note: The coverage and score data comes from a 3rd party AI*

The `colors.tsv` dataset has one row per major color present in the photo. The dataset tells which colors are contained within a photo, their coverage as a percentage, and a score for how in focus the color is.

| Field                     | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| photo_id                  | ID of the Unsplash photo |
| hex                       | Hexadecimal representation of the color |
| red                       | Red component of the photo in the RGB system |
| green                     | Green component of the photo in the RGB system |
| blue                      | Blue component of the photo in the RGB system |
| keyword                   | Name of the closest color as a [CSS color keyword](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp) |
| coverage                  | Pixel coverage of the color as a percentage |
| score                     | Score of the color in the photo (including the notion of focus) |

## Combining datasets

You can merge the different datasets through the primary key ID fields (usually the `photo_id` field). With this you'll be able to cross-reference properties from the photos dataset with data from the keywords or conversions dataset.
